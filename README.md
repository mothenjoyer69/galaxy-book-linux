# galaxy-book-linux
Automated script to build a bootable distro for the Samsung Galaxy Book2 (SDM850). This is purely testing right now and 99% of it is done outside of this script. AKA this won't just boot, nor will it function or anything else.

Status:
> GRUB works reliably. Major problems with successfully booting.

Todo:
> Begin to debug the EFI side of things, as well as GRUB as it has been a problem in the past. Firmware to be ignored for now.
